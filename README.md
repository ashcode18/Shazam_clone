Shazam Clone: Audio Recognition System
This project is a simple audio recognition system built in Python, inspired by Shazam. It records audio input, extracts features, and then identifies or stores the audio based on its unique "fingerprint."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:

Audio Recording: Records real-time audio from the microphone for a fixed duration.

Audio Fingerprinting: Uses the spectrogram of the audio to generate a unique fingerprint for each recording.

Song Identification: Compares the generated fingerprint against a collection of known fingerprints to identify the song.

Song Storage: Stores newly recorded songs and their fingerprints in a dictionary for future identification.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Libraries Used:
pyaudio: Used for real-time audio recording.
librosa: For audio processing, including spectrogram generation and feature extraction.
scipy (maximum_filter): To extract peak values from the spectrogram and identify the most significant points in the audio.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How It Works:

Audio Input:
The program records audio for a set duration using pyaudio. The audio is captured from the microphone, and the raw data is saved as a .wav file.

Audio Feature Extraction:
Once the audio file is saved, librosa is used to load the file and generate a spectrogram. This spectrogram visually represents the frequency content of the audio over time.

Peak Detection & Hashing:
Peaks are detected in the spectrogram using a maximum filter. These peaks correspond to significant points in the audio and form the "fingerprint."
The fingerprint is generated by hashing these peaks into a unique identifier for the audio.

Identification and Storage:
The system compares the fingerprint of the newly recorded audio with the fingerprints of previously stored songs.
If a match is found, the song is identified. If not, the new song is added to the collection.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:
Recording a New Song:
To record a new song and generate its fingerprint, call the takingAudioInput(name) function with the name of the song.

Identifying a Song:
To identify a song, call the takingAudioInput(name, to_identify=True) function with the name of the song you want to identify. The system will attempt to match the fingerprint with existing ones.

Example:
# Recording a new song
takingAudioInput("Hardest-Part by Olivia_Dean")

# Recording another song
takingAudioInput("Sapta Sagara")

# Identifying a song
takingAudioInput("test", to_identify=True)
